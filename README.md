This repository was forked from [simonrice/imapsync](https://www.github.com/simonrice/homebrew-imapsync), which was copied over from an unmerged Homebrew fork by budrick. To manage perl dependencies, i took code from this [commit](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/commit/4e0dad01bc326ab3d31908fdb3c201bcac233903) by adamv.
